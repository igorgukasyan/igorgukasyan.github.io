Hi, I'm Igor, and I like data. This website is a web-portfolio of my data-science-related projects, personal and professional.
I mostly code in Python and R, but occasional Java Script or HTML do not scare me. I know APIs, predictive modeling, clustering, dashboard-building, and more. By the way, I am a master in 'data science and marketing analytics', according to Erasmus School of Economics. You can find my thesis here, too!
Apart from data, I like squash, brazilian jiu-jitsu, fashion, skating and video games. Please do not hesitate to reach out if you want to offer me a full-time job, or just have a chat :)

title: "Master Thesis: Enhancing Content-Based Music Recommendation with Lyrical Features"
date: 2025-03-10
---

In September 2025, I successfully defended my thesis at Erasmus School of Economics, Erasmus University, for the 'Data Science and Marketing Analytics' program.

In the thesis, I use listening history data from thousands of users across about 40,000 songs to show that certain linguistic features can improve content-based music recommendation systems.
Below, you can find the full version of my work, and the code is posted on github.

In the next post, I will break down my thesis in simpler terms and share some extra thoughts that make it into the paper.

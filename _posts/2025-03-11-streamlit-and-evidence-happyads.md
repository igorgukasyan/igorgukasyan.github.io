As a part of my freelance work at a marketing agency HappyAds, I created a series of dashboards to help teams access their data in a fast and convenient manner. I want to share two examples from different frameworks in order to demonstrate my technical versatility and dashboarding experience.

> **The data displayed is random!**

The dashboard below was created using Python and Streamlit open-source framework. Data is pulled from multiple sources including TikTok's API. Last column represents advice based on the results of a machine learning model. It is meant to display most relevant data, improving reaction time of the buyer team.
![]({{ page.streamlit | relative_url }})

The dashboard below was created using Evidence's native scripting language and displays the performance of marketing assets. 
![]({{ page.evidence | relative_url }})
